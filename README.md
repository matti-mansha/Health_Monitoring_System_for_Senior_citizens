# Health_Monitoring_System_for_Senior_citizens
#Introduction
In this modern era, Almost everyone from children to adults is busy with their work. And
if they have elderly people to take care of, it is almost impossible for them to do this.
Human action recognition (HAR) is considered as one of the most promising assistive
technology tools to support elderly’s daily life by monitoring their cognitive and physical
function through daily activities In previous approaches in HAR the proposed system
were able to recognize activity from offline videos.We propose a complete healthcare
monitoring system with a skeleton-based approach for elderly people in which they will
be continuously monitored using cameras such as Kinect 360. The system uses a variant
of RNN IndRNN which is trained on 12 health-sensitive activities to recognize the activity
of elderly people such that if health-sensitive activity occurs and is recognized by our
model it will instantly notify users or doctors so immediate actions can take place.The
outcomes show that the trained algorithm can be used to identify HAR, which is very
encouraging.
